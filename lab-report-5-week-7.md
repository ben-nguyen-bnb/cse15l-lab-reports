Week 7
# Week 7 Lab Report

## Part 1 

*Instructions for First Task*
Second Task:
In `DocSearchServer.java`, change the name of the `start` paraneter of `getFiles`, and of its uses, to instead be called `base`.

Instructions: (Starting in `week6-skill-demo1` directory)
1. `vim D` `<tab>` `<Enter>`
2. `/star` `<Enter>`
3. `ce`
4. `base` `<esc>`
5. `n.`
6. `n.`
7. `:wq` `<Enter>`

The screenshot displays the `DocSearchServer.java` file opened up in vim.

2. `/star` `<Enter>`

The screenshot displays the first letter of the first instance of `start` being highlighted

3. `ce` 
![Image](ce.jpg)

The screenshot displays the word `start` being deleted and going into insert mode.

4. `base` `<esc>`
![Image](base.jpg)

The screenshot displays the word `start` being replaced by `base` and going back to normal mode

5. `n.`
![Image](n.jpg)

The screenshot displays vim searching and replacing the next instance of `start` with `base`

6. `n.`
![Image](n2.jpg)

The screenshot displays vim searching and replacing the next instance of `start` with `base`

7. `:wq` `<Enter>`
![Image](wq.jpg)

The screenshot displays vim saving and exiting the file and going back to the terminal


## Part 2

Time to Edit in VSCode and copying over file: 32.81 seconds

Time to Edit in vim: 22.83 seconds

There was some difficulty trying to find all the cases of `start` manually when editing on the VSCode
There was not much difficulty using vim aside from changing to the appropriate directory to open the file in vim.

*Question 1*

As of right now, I would still prefer to use VSCode to work on a program remotely, mainly because of how I am not used to working in vim yet. I feel more comfortable making the edits in VSCode simply because it resembles more like the usual text editor that I am familiar with. If I were more used to vim, I could definitely see me using it over VSCode because of how much more faster and more efficient it is.

*Question 2*

If I were to be working on a larger projet, I would prefer to use VSCode over vim. Of course this may simply be because I am unfamiliar with vim, but I think that working on multiple files and being able to switch and make simple edits to multiple files would be easier on VSCode. I don't quite see a simple way to work on a program that needs multiple files to work aside from opening vim on multiple terminals, which to me seems that it would eventually make things more confusing (again there may be a better way to work on multiple files, if there is then I am unfamiliar with it) . However, if I were to be more comformtable with vim and able to use it effectively, I would say that I would use vim over VSCode when working on smaller projects or making simpler edits.
